  Our group focuses on using and developing accurate theoretical methods to
  study molecules, reactions, clusters, and extended systems. In particular, we
  specialize in *ab initio* (meaning "from the beginning") methods based on quantum
  mechanics, combining concepts and techniques from chemistry, physics,
  mathematics, and computer science.
