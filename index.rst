ManeFrame II Documentation
==========================

The mission of the Center for Scientific Computation at Southern Methodist University is to stimulate interdisciplinary education and research in simulation-based engineering and science.
We are motivated by the fact that computer simulation has become an essential component of research in most disciplines in engineering and science, and that advances in computing, networking, and data storage technologies are likely to accelerate this trend. At the same time, it is recognized that our nation's position of dominance in this area can no longer be taken for granted. Thus we believe that the education of the next generation of computational scientists and engineers is an urgent challenge which SMU must accept. 

Goals of the CSC
----------------

Education and training focused on high-performance computing algorithms, software, and hardware.
Formation of interdisciplinary research teams addressing cutting-edge applications.
Rapid communication of faculty and student research accomplishments.
