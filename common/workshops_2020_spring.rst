Spring 2020
===========

The Spring 2020 Center for Research Computing (CRC) workshop series will
provide a hands-on experience that will guide researchers from the basics of
using SMU's supercomputing resources to advanced parallelization and
application specific usage. The topics will cover information useful for
researchers to quickly begin to use the advanced compute capabilities provided
with the cluster. New users are encouraged to take advantage of the
introductory "Introduction to Using M2" workshop that will be given once
monthly during the semester.
 
Workshops will be given weekly on Tuesdays in Fondren Library East Room 110
from 2:00 to 4:00 PM. There will not be a workshop on March 17.
