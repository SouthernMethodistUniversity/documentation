Spring 2022
===========

The Spring 2022 Center for Research Computing workshop series will provide a
hands-on experience that will guide researchers from the basics of using SMU's
supercomputing resources to advanced parallelization and application specific
usage. The topics will cover information useful for researchers to quickly
begin to use the advanced compute capabilities provided with the cluster. New
users are encouraged to take advantage of the introductory "ManeFrame II (M2)
Introduction" workshop that will be given once monthly during the semester.
