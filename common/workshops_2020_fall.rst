Fall 2020
=========

The Fall 2020 CSC workshop series will provide a hands-on experience that will
guide researchers from the basics of using SMU's supercomputing resources to
advanced parallelization and application specific usage. The topics will cover
information useful for researchers to quickly begin to use the advanced compute
capabilities provided with the cluster. New users are encouraged to take
advantage of the introductory "M2 Introduction" workshop that
will be given once monthly during the semester.

Workshops will be given asynchronously and posted weekly. Open workshop help
sessions will be held each Wednesdays via Zoom from 2:00 to 4:00 PM. Register
to receive Zoom coordinates.
