Faculty Partnership Program
===========================

Purpose
-------

.. include:: /common/faculty_partnership_purpose.rst

Procedure
---------

Faculty partners will enter into agreements with the Director of the CSC for
the purchase, maintenance, and use of hardware and software. The details of
these agreements in any individual case will be spelled out in a Memorandum of
Understanding which can be executed either at the time of submission of a grant
proposal or at the time of purchase. A typical agreement would entail the
purchase of compute nodes and an acceptable warranty agreement using an
individual's research funds. The center would agree to install and operate the
equipment over a specified time period, bearing all power, cooling, networking,
administration and similar costs. In addition, the faculty member and any other
users he/she designates would have priority access to these or an equivalent
number of nodes. When not in use by the preferred users, they would be
accessible to all faculty and student users.

Faculty who might be interested in becoming partners with the CSC are
encouraged to contact the Director, leaving sufficient time to develop an
agreement on the details of the arrangement before any proposal is due.
