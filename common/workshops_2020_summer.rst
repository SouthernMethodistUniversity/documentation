Summer 2020
===========

The Summer 2020 Center for Research Computing workshop series will provide a
hands-on experience that will guide researchers from the basics of using SMUâ€™s
supercomputing resources to advanced parallelization and application specific
usage. The topics will cover information useful for researchers to quickly
begin to use the advanced compute capabilities provided with the cluster. New
users are encouraged to take advantage of the introductory "HPC Usage and
Development Introduction" workshop on July 6.

The workshops will be given weekly on Mondays July 6 through August 3 from 9:00
AM to 4:00 PM.
