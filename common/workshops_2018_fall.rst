Fall 2018
=========

The Fall 2018 CSC workshop series will provide a hands-on experience that will
guide researchers from the basics of using SMU's supercomputing resources to
advanced parallelization and application specific usage. The topics will cover
information useful for researchers to quickly begin to use the new compute
capabilities provided with the new cluster. New users are encouraged to take
advantage of the introductory "Introduction to ManeFrame II (M2)" workshop that
will be given once monthly during the semester. Users are encourged to stop by
to discuss M2 usage and application issues during the open help sessions.

Workshops will be given weekly on Wednesday's in Fondren Library East Room 110
from 12:00 to 2:00 PM. Register `here
