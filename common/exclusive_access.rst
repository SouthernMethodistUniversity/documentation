Temporary Exlusive Access to M2 Resources
=========================================

Under special circumstances the Director may grant temporary exclusive access
to some M2 nodes. Researchers requesting special access should submit
`this form <https://smu.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0W0Go6bvMfOO5I9>`_.

It is expected that such requests will be rare, and the Director's decision
will be based both on the urgency of the need and on the potential impact on
other users.
