Version Control Systems
=======================

(adapted from `A visual guide to version
control <http://betterexplained.com/articles/a-visual-guide-to-version-control/>`__)

Version Control (aka *revision control* or *source control*) lets you
track the history of your files over time. Why do you care? So when you
mess up you can easily get back to a previous version that worked.

You've probably invented your own simple version control system in the
past without realizing it. Do you have an directories with files like
this?

-  my_function.c
-  my_function2.c
-  my_function3.c
-  my_function4.c
-  my_function_old.c
-  my_function_older.c
-  my_function_even_older.c

It's why we use "Save As"; you want to save the new file without writing
over the old one. It's a common problem, and solutions are usually like
this:

-  Make a *single backup copy* (e.g., Document.old.txt).
-  If we're clever, we add a *version number* or *date*: e.g.,
   Document_V1.txt, DocumentMarch2012.txt.
-  We may even use a *shared folder* so other people can see and edit
   files without sending them by email. Hopefully they rename the file
   after they save it.

Why use a VCS?
--------------

Our shared folder/naming system is fine for class projects or one-time
papers, but is exceptionally bad for software projects. Do you imagine
that the Windows source code sits in a shared folder named something
like "Windows7-Latest-New", for anyone to edit? Or that every programmer
just works on different files in the same folder?

For projects that are large, fast-changing, or have multiple authors, a
Version Control System (VCS) is critical. Think of a VCS as a "file
database", that helps to track changes and avoid general chaos. A good
VCS does the following:

-  *Backup and Restore* -- files are saved as they are edited, and you
   can jump to any moment in time. Need that file as it was on March 8?
   No problem.
-  *Synchronization* -- Allows people to share files and stay up to date
   with the latest version.
-  *Short-term undo* -- Did you try to "fix" a file and just mess it up?
   Throw away your changes and go back to the last "correct" version in
   the database.
-  *Long-term undo* -- Sometimes we mess up bad. Suppose you made a
   change a year ago, and it had a bug that you never caught until now.
   Jump back to the old version, and see what change was made that day.
   Maybe you can fix that one bug and not have to undo your work for the
   whole year?
-  *Track Changes* -- As files are updated, you can leave messages
   explaining why the change happened (these are stored in the VCS, not
   the file). This makes it easy to see how a file is evolving over
   time, and why it was changed.
-  *Track Ownership* -- A VCS tags every change with the name of the
   person who made it, which can be hepful for laying blame *or* giving
   credit.
-  *Sandboxing* (i.e. insurance against yourself) -- Plan to make a big
   change? You can make temporary changes in an isolated area, test and
   work out the kinks before "checking in" your set of changes.
-  *Branching and merging* -- A larger sandbox. You can branch a copy of
   your code into a separate area and modify it in isolation (tracking
   changes separately). Later, you can merge your work back into the
   common area.

Shared folders are quick and simple, but can't provide these critical
features.

General Definitions
-------------------

Most version control systems involve the following concepts, though the
labels may be different.

Basic setup:

-  *Repository (repo)* -- The database storing the files.
-  *Server* -- The computer storing the repo.
-  *Client* -- The computer connecting to the repo.
-  *Working Set/Working Copy* -- Your local directory of files, where
   you make changes.
-  *Trunk/Main* -- The primary location for code in the repo. Think of
   code as a family tree â€” the trunk is the main line.

Basic actions:

-  *Add* -- Put a file into the repo for the first time, i.e. begin
   tracking it with Version Control.
-  *Revision* -- What version a file is on (v1, v2, v3, etc.).
-  *Head/Tip* -- The latest revision in the repo.
-  *Check out* -- Download a file from the repo.
-  *Check in* -- Upload a file to the repository (if it has changed).
   The file gets a new revision number, and people can "check out" the
   latest one.
-  *Checkin Message* -- A short message describing what was changed.
-  *Changelog/History* -- A list of changes made to a file since it was
   created.
-  *Update/Sync* -- Synchronize your files with the latest from the
   repository. This lets you grab the latest revisions of all files.
-  *Revert* -- Throw away your local changes and reload the latest
   version from the repository.

More advanced actions

-  *Branch* -- Create a separate copy of a file/folder for private use
   (bug fixing, testing, etc). Branch is both a verb ("branch the code")
   and a noun ("Which branch is it in?").
-  *Diff/Change/Delta* -- Finding the differences between two files.
   Useful for seeing what changed between revisions.
-  *Merge/Patch* -- Apply the changes from one file to another, to bring
   it up-to-date. For example, you can merge features from one branch
   into another.
-  *Conflict* -- When pending changes to a file contradict each other
   (both changes cannot be applied automatically).
-  *Resolve* -- Fixing the changes that contradict each other and
   checking in the final version.
-  *Locking* -- Taking control of a file so nobody else can edit it
   until you unlock it. Some version control systems use this to avoid
   conflicts.
-  *Breaking the lock* -- Forcibly unlocking a file so you can edit it.
   It may be needed if someone locks a file and goes on vacation.
-  *Check out for edit* -- Checking out an "editable" version of a file.
   Some VCSes have editable files by default, others require an explicit
   command.

A typical scenario goes like this:

-  Alice adds a file (ShoppingList.txt) to the repository.
-  Alice checks out the file, makes a change (puts "milk" on the list),
   and checks it back in with a checkin message ("Added delicious
   beverage.").
-  The next morning, Bob updates his local working set and sees the
   latest revision of ShoppingList.txt, which contains "milk".
-  Bob adds "donuts" to the list, while Alice also adds "eggs" to the
   list.
-  Bob checks the list in, with a checking message `"Mmmmm,
   donuts" <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-4P1WPE-Qg>`__.
-  Alice updates her copy of the list before checking it in, and notices
   that there is a conflict. Realizing that the order of items doesn't
   matter, she merges the changes by putting both "donuts" and "eggs" on
   the list, and checks in the final version.

Standard VCS Programs
---------------------

ManeFrame II (M2) has a number of programs installed to enable version control
over your codes. The most popular of these systems are listed below (in
chronological order, from oldest to youngest) -- all of these are
installed on M2 and are in your ``$PATH`` by default.

CVS
~~~

Originally developed in 1990,
`CVS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System>`__ is
one of the oldest version systems still in use today. It follows a
client-server approach, in which all repository duties are handled by a
server, to which clients connect to "check out" and "check in" files.

The primary CVS commands are:

-  ``cvs add`` -- adds a new file/directory to the repository
-  ``cvs admin`` -- administration front end for the underlying revision
   control system
-  ``cvs checkout`` -- checkout sources for editing
-  ``cvs commit`` -- checks files into the repository
-  ``cvs diff`` -- checks for differences between revisions
-  ``cvs history`` -- shows status of files and users
-  ``cvs import`` -- import sources into CVS
-  ``cvs remove`` -- removes an entry from the repository
-  ``cvs status`` -- status info on the revisions
-  ``cvs tag`` -- add a tag to checked out version
-  ``cvs update`` -- brings work tree in sync with repository

While there are many `criticisms of
CVS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System#Criticism>`__,
it's longevity has resulted in `CVS support by a large number of
*Integrated Desktop Environments*
(IDEs) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_Versions_System#IDEs_with_support_for_CVS>`__
on all major operating systems with native support for CVS-hosted
projects.

SVN
~~~

`Apache Subversion <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion>`__
(SVN) was initially released in 2000, as an effort to write an
open-source version control system that behaved similarly to CVS, but
with a variety of bug fixes and feature improvements. Resultingly, SVN
similarly relies on a client-server approach, and it's commands are
quite similar to those for CVS.

The primary SVN commands include:

-  ``svn help`` -- provides a summary of the available commands.
-  ``svn checkout`` or ``svn co`` -- pulls an SVN tree from the server
   (you should only need to do this once).
-  ``svn add`` -- adds a newly-created file or directory to the
   repository.
-  ``svn delete`` or ``svn del`` or ``svn remove`` or ``svn rm``
   --deletes the local file immediately, and notifies the repository
   that on the next commit, the file should be deleted from there as
   well.
-  ``svn status`` or ``svn stat`` -- displays the status of working
   directories and files.
-  ``svn update`` or ``svn up`` -- synchronizes your local version of
   the code with the server. If you have made local changes, it will try
   and merge any changes on the server with your changes on your
   machine.
-  ``svn commit`` or ``svn ci`` -- recursively sends your changes to the
   SVN server.

   -  If called with specific files/directories as arguments, it will
      send only those.
   -  If given no arguments it will send all changes.
   -  The ``-m`` option should always be used to pass a log message to
      the command.

-  ``svn diff`` -- shows all changes between the local version of a file
   and the version in the repository. May also be used to see changes
   between specific versions of the file with the syntax
   ``svn diff -r revision1:revision2 FILENAME``
-  ``svn move SRC DEST`` or ``svn mv SRC DEST`` or
   ``svn rename SRC DEST`` or ``svn ren SRC DEST`` -- moves a file from
   one directory to another or renames a file in your local directory
   immediately, and performs the same changes on the server upon
   committing.
-  ``svn revert`` -- replaces a local file(s) with the one in the
   repository.
-  ``svn log`` â€“- displays the log messages from checkins to to the
   repository.
-  ``svn resolve`` -- if an update showed a conflict (a file marked with
   a "C"), then once you have manually merged the two versions of file,
   this command will set the file's status to "resolved".

As with any project, SVN also has a number of
`criticisms <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Subversion#Limitations_and_problems>`__,
but again since it has been widely used for over a decade, subversion
support has been integrated into a variety of `GUI front-ends and
IDEs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_software_that_uses_Subversion>`__.

In addition, there are a number of web sites that will host open-source
SVN-based software projects free of charge, including:

-  `Google code <http://code.google.com/hosting/>`__
-  `SourceForge <http://sourceforge.net/>`__
-  `CloudForge <http://info.cloudforge.com/freeplan.html>`__
-  `Bounty Source <http://www.bountysource.com/>`__

Git
~~~

Originally released in 2005 (by `Linus
Torvalds <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds>`__ himself!),
`Git <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)>`__ was one of the
first version control systems that followed a *distributed revision
control* model (DRCS), in which it is no longer required to have a
single server that all clients connect with. Instead, DRCS follows a
peer-to-peer approach. in which each peer's working copy of the codebase
is a fully-functional repository. These work by exchanging patches (sets
of changes) between peers, resulting in some `key benefits over previous
centralized
systems <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control#Distributed_vs._centralized>`__

The
`commands <https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/STASH/Basic+Git+commands>`__
used for interacting with Git are nearly identical to those for SVN,
with a few additions/exceptions:

-  ``git clone`` -- this is the primary mechanism for retrieving a local
   copy of a Git repository. Unlike the CVS and SVN ``checkout``
   commands, the result is a full repository that may act as a server
   for other client repositories.
-  ``git pull`` -- this fetches and merges changes on the remote server
   to your working repository.
-  ``git push`` -- the opposite of ``pull``, this sends all changes in
   your local repository to a remote repository.

However, *unlike SVN*, Git does not allow you to use the shortcut names
for standard commands; for example ``git ci`` is an illegal command, but
``git commit`` is allowed.

While distributed version control systems no longer require a main
server, it is often useful to have a centralized, "agreed-upon" main
repository that all users can access. As with subversion, there are a
number of web sites that will host open-source Git-based software
projects free of charge, including:

-  `Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/dashboard/overview>`__
-  `GitHub <https://github.com/>`__
-  `Gitorious <https://gitorious.org/>`__
-  `CloudForge <http://www.cloudforge.com/>`__
-  `ProjectLocker <http://projectlocker.com/>`__
-  `Assembla <http://offers.assembla.com/free-git-hosting/>`__

Mercurial
~~~~~~~~~

Like Git,
`Mercurial <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial_(software)>`__ was
first released in 2005, and is a widely-used distributed revision
control system. It is primarily implemented using Python, and is
available on all major operating systems.

Again, like Git, Mercurial commands are similar to CVS and SVN, with a
few notable exceptions (note that ``hg`` is the chemical symbol for
mercury):

-  ``hg clone`` -- the primary mechanism for retrieving a local copy of
   a mercurial repository; the result of which is a full repository that
   may act as a server for other client repositories.
-  ``hg pull`` -- this fetches all changes on the remote server and adds
   them to your working repository, but *unlike Git it does not merge
   them in*, allowing you control over which remote changesets are
   incorporated into your local sandbox, and which are not.
-  ``hg up`` -- this is the command that updates your local sandbox with
   changes that have been pulled into your working repository.
-  ``hg push`` -- like Git, this command sends all changes in your local
   repository to a remote repository.

Unlike Git, but as with SVN, Mercurial allows use of popular command
shortcuts like ``ci``, ``stat`` and ``up`` instead of their longer
alternatives (``commit``, ``status`` and ``update``).

As with Git and Subversion, there are a variety of web sites that will
host open-source Mercurial repositories free of charge, including:

-  `Bitbucket <https://bitbucket.org/dashboard/overview>`__
-  `Assembla <http://www.assembla.com/>`__
-  `Google code <http://code.google.com/projecthosting/>`__

Mercurial Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We'll get a little experience with using Mercurial to "collaborate" on a
shared project.

The first step in using a version control system on an existing
repository is to do the initial download of the code from the main
repository. This repository can often be on a standalone server, on a
public a web site, or it can even reside in someone else's home
directory. Here, we'll use one that I've set up for this class on the
public web server `bitbucket.org <http://bitbucket.org>`__. In
Mercurial, the initial download of the code uses the ``clone`` command:

.. code:: bash

    $ hg clone https://drreynolds@bitbucket.org/drreynolds/smuhpc-workshop-example

When the command completes, you should have a new directory named
``smuhpc-workshop-example``. Enter that directory,

.. code:: bash

    $ cd smuhpc-workshop-example
    $ ls
    driver.cpp     vector_difference.cpp   vector_sum.cpp
    one_norm.cpp   vector_product.cpp 

You should notice the files we used earlier in this tutorial. Since
Mercurial is a *distributed* version control system, this directory is
now a new repository of your own.

In this directory, add a new file of the form *lastname.txt* containing
your first name, e.g.,

.. code:: bash

    $ echo "Rob" > Kalescky.txt

To see which files have changed in comparison with the last saved state
of the repository, you can use the ``status`` command:

.. code:: bash

    $ hg status
    ? Kalescky.txt

The "?" indicates that there is a new file in the directory that the
repository does not yet know about. We can add these files to the
repository with the ``add`` command:

.. code:: bash

    $ hg add Kalescky.txt

Re-running ``status``, we see that the repository now knows about the
file:

.. code:: bash

    $ hg status
    A Kalescky.txt

where, the "A" denotes that the file has been added to the repository.
Other keys include:

-  ``M`` -- the file has been modified
-  ``!`` -- the file has been deleted
-  ``R`` -- the file has been removed from the repository

If you want to see the specific changes that have been made to all of
the Mercurial-tracked files, you can use the ``diff`` command:

.. code:: bash

    $ hg diff
    diff -r ad44a3024020 Kalescky.txt
    --- /dev/null    Thu Jan 01 00:00:00 1970 +0000
    +++ b/Kalescky.txt   Fri May 31 13:46:17 2013 -0500
    @@ -0,0 +1,1 @@
    +Daniel

where we see that there is a new line "Rob" (denoted by the ``+``) that
has been added.

To save this change into the repository, we must ``commit`` the changes.
To do so, we must supply both a log message using the ``-m`` flag, and
our name (in order to give credit and/or lay blame) with the ``-u``
flag. For example, my commit message could be something like this:

.. code:: bash

    $ hg commit -u rkalescky -m "added a file with my name" Kalescky.txt

Once this command has completed, we see that the local directory is
current with our local repository:

.. code:: bash

    $ hg status

(note that nothing is listed).

When working on a project with others, you will eventually wish to share
your code by "pushing" it back up to a shared repository. This can also
be quite helpful if you develop your project on different computers, so
that instead of copying the files manually by email, ``rsync`` or
``scp``, you can just push your changes up to the repository from one
computer, and clone/pull them down to another.

The command to push files back to the main repository is ``push``. We
will not do so here, since in order to push to
`bitbucket.org <http://bitbucket.org>`__ you must first set up a
Bitbucket account.

However, if you did have a Bitbucket account, prior to pushing your
code, you should always retrieve any changes that your collaborators
have made to the repository by using a "pull" and an "update" (and
possibly a "merge" if necessary). To retrieve these changes:

.. code:: bash

    $ hg pull
    $ hg update

If the ``update`` command returns successfully, then you can push your
changes back to my example repository with the command

.. code:: bash

    $ hg push

However, if the ``update`` command complained about changes needing to
be merged (meaning that someone else checked things in, so your changes
need to be merged with his/hers), then you can ``merge`` via

.. code:: bash

    $ hg merge

Assuming that your modifications do not collide with anyone else's, this
should be successful, in which case you need to check in the merge

.. code:: bash

    $ hg commit -u rkalescky -m "merged to tip"

Once you're certain that you have finished retrieving and merging all
changes from the shared repository, you ``push`` via

.. code:: bash

    $ hg push

Typically this process is not difficult, since you will usually be
editing different files than your collaborators.

Comparison with Dropbox/Google Drive/OneDrive/etc.
--------------------------------------------------

With the advent of "the cloud", we are inundated with options for
storing files and sharing them with others. As a result, many of us have
come up with preferred strategies for working with our files, such as
with `Dropbox <http://dropbox.com>`__, `Google
Drive <http://drive.google.com>`__,
`OneDrive <https://onedrive.live.com>`__,
`Box <https://www.box.com/>`__, ...

Unfortunately, while these cloud storage options are great solutions for
sharing files with others, they are *poor* choices for typical software
projects:

1. It is typically very difficult (or impossible) to retrieve old
   versions of a file, and even when possible, it may only be done based
   on date/time, and does not include "checkin" messages describing the
   differences between files.

   VCS systems store specific "versions" of each file, with checkins
   labeled using (hopefully descriptive) messages. Better yet, VCS
   systems allow you to "tag" a specific state of the repository (e.g.,
   to mark it for release as version "2.0"). The repository may be
   "reverted" to its status at any tag or after any checkin with only
   one (or a few) simple commands.

2. Unless all authors *never* edit the same file, merging changes
   between multiple authors becomes difficult, if not impossible. VCS
   systems allow multiple users to edit the same file, merging changes
   automatically (if made to separate parts of the file), or requesting
   the newest checkin to manually merge portions of the code that
   overlap.

3. No "sandboxing" of code -- the moment that you edit the file it is
   changed in the cloud, making it impossible for one user to compile
   while another is actively editing and saving files (since they
   typically will not compile at every save).

   VCS systems allow you to save files to disk for compilation and
   testing, and only share the changes with others *when you decide that
   the changes should be shared*.

4. No simple "diff" capabilities, to see *exactly* what has changed in
   each file at any point in time.

   VCS systems all supply some kind of "diff" to allow quick comparison
   between versions of a code.

All of that said, some people use a combination of a VCS and a cloud
storage solution to get the benefits of both. For example, many smaller
groups will set up a distributed version control system (Git or
Mercurial) *inside* a Dropbox folder, that they can then share with
other developers (for example, see `this blog
post <http://rogerstringer.com/2012/04/16/using-dropbox-as-a-git-repository/>`__).
In this way, you can benefit from using the cloud to share files with
others (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.), while also benefiting from a VCS
system for all of the options discussed above.

However, a big problem with the above cloud-based approach is that the
client software needs to be installed on all machines where you plan to
access the in-cloud repository. While you can certainly install these
programs on your own computers, in general *you cannot install them on
shared clusters* (like M2). So if you do decide to use a
customized cloud+VCS system, you'll still need to manually copy your
codes to/from M2 (or other shared clusters), and ensure that any
updates to the repository and/or to files on M2 are manually
merged back-and-forth.

In my experience, it's much simpler (and just as free) to use a
professional repository hosting service like
`Bitbucket <http://bitbucket.org>`__.
