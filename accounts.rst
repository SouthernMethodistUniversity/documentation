Accounts
########

Request an Account
==================

SMU faculty/staff can request an account by sending an email (if you are a
student or postdoc please ask your supervisor, sponsor, or adviser to send
an email) to \ `SMU HPC Admins <mailto:help@smu.edu?subject=HPC%20Account%20Request>`__ with the following details.

-  Full Name
-  Department
-  A valid SMU email for SMU faculty/staff/student/post-doc
-  Duration for which the account should remain active
-  If the account is for a class, course number, name, and professor

If you are an external research collaborator please have your sponsor
request a sponsored account at \ help@smu.edu. Once your account has
been created please request HPC access at \ `SMU HPC Admins <mailto:help@smu.edu?subject=HPC%20Account%20Request>`__.

Reset Account Password
======================

ManeFrame II uses SMU’s authentication system, which means that your
username and password are based on your SMU credentials. Your username
is the first part of your SMU email address, i.e. janeuser for
janeuser@smu.edu, and your password is your SMU password. SMU’s password
tool can be used to change or reset your password
(https://pwreset.smu.edu). However, note that this changes your password
for all SMU services such as email as well.

Terminate an Existing Account
=============================

Please send a request to the \ `SMU HPC
Admins <mailto:help@smu.edu?subject=HPC>`__ with a short explanation of
reason for the termination.

Account and Account Password Sharing Policy
===========================================

No two individuals should share the same ManeFrame II account, nor should
two individuals share the password of the same account. Each individual is
entitled to have their own account hence please request one.
