Reset Account Password
======================

ManeFrame II uses SMU’s authentication system, which means that your
username and password are based on your SMU credentials. Your username
is the first part of your SMU email address, i.e. janeuser for
janeuser@smu.edu, and your password is your SMU password. SMU’s password
tool can be used to change or reset your password
(https://pwreset.smu.edu). However, note that this changes your password
for all SMU services such as email as well.

Terminate an Existing Account
=============================

Please send a request to the \ `SMU HPC
Admins <mailto:help@smu.edu?subject=HPC>`__ with a short explanation of
reason for the termination.

Account and Account Password Sharing Policy
===========================================

No two individuals should share the same ManeFrame account, nor should
two individuals share the password of the same ManeFrame account. Each
individual is entitled to have their own account hence please request
one.
