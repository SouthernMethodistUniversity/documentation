Accounts
########

Request an Account
==================

SMU faculty/staff can request an account by filling out the `New Account
Form`_. If you are a student or postdoc please ask your supervisor, sponsor, or
adviser to submit the `New Account Form`_.

If you are an external research collaborator please have your sponsor request a
sponsored account at `help@smu.edu <mailto:help@smu.edu>`__. Once the account
has been created the sponor can request an M2 account via `New Account Form`_.

Reset Account Password
======================

ManeFrame II uses SMU’s authentication system, which means that your
username and password are based on your SMU credentials. Your username
is the first part of your SMU email address, i.e. janeuser for
janeuser@smu.edu, and your password is your SMU password. SMU’s password
tool can be used to change or reset your password
(https://pwreset.smu.edu). However, note that this changes your password
for all SMU services such as email as well.

Terminate an Existing Account
=============================

Please send a request to the `SMU HPC Admins
<mailto:help@smu.edu?subject=HPC>`__ with a short explanation of reason for the
termination.

Account and Account Password Sharing Policy
===========================================

No two individuals should share the same ManeFrame II account, nor should
two individuals share the password of the same account. Each individual is
entitled to have their own account hence please request one.
